# Battleship Final Project

I am going to create a Battleship GUI where the player plays against the computer.  Each player secretly arranges their ships on a 10x10 game board grid.  They then try to "sink" all of their oppenent's ships by taking turns guessing the coordinates of a target square.  If the coordinate match the location of an opponent's ship then it counts as a "hit."  My program will display two game board grids.  One grid will show the location of your ships and record the opponent's shots.  The other grid will record your shots and hits taken against your opponent throughout the game.
