# Battleship Final Project

In this version of battleship, the player plays against the computer.  The player can choose their own game settings byt deciding how many columns, rows, and ships they want to play with.  Each player then secretly arranges their ships on the game board.  They then take turns trying to "sink" all of their oppenent's ships by taking turns guessing the coordinates of a target square.  If the coordinate match the location of an opponent's ship then it counts as a "hit."  My program will display two game board grids.  One grid will show the location of your ships and record the opponent's shots.  The other grid will record your shots and hits taken against your opponent throughout the game.
